# FluidSim
## Project Overview
This is a contiuation from my FluidSim 2D repo designed again from the groud up with new features, goals, and languages.

This project is designed to be a long term look at fuild simulation and potential applications of machine learning. I want to be able to make a 'virtual windtunnel' simulation that can handel a variety of fluids with a variety of properties. Additionally aiming to develop and test machine learning algorythems against my hybrid grid-particle simulation implementation. The project aims to test for efficency, accuracy and process time of the neural network bases approach, within my limitations, as I am not in possetion of a computation farm.
